# go-from-zero-to-production

## Background
I recently accepted an offer for a platform/infra engineering role at a large tech company.
The team primarily uses Go, but I currently have little to no production experience with Go.

This repository documents my daily learning, experiments, mistakes, and progress
as I ramp up Go for real-world platform and infrastructure development.
